                        We offer a choice of spice levels (Mild, Medium, Hot, and Thai Hot) but spice can be different for everyone. We usually suggest that you are on the side of caution and choose a lower spice level because you can add spice in, but can’t take it out! We do not offer discounts or refunds for a preferred different spice level, but please let us know if you’d like us to add a side of ground chili, chili sauce or Sriracha for you.)

                        It’s possible your delivery partner might cancel the delivery if they’re unable to find or reach you. When they arrive at your delivery address, they’re prompted to contact you so it’s a good idea to keep your phone nearby when you’re expecting the food to arrive. If a delivery partner made a reasonable effort to contact you after arriving at your requested location, you may not be eligible for a refund.
